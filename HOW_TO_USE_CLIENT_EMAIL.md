## 📞 CLIENT SUPPORT SCRIPT:

If client calls/emails with questions, use these talking points:

### "Is this really cheaper?"
"Yes! Most website platforms charge $168-276/year. You're paying only $21.77 because we use Cloudflare's free hosting (same infrastructure used by 20% of Fortune 1000 companies). You're only paying for domain ($9.77) and email ($12)."

### "Why do I need to create accounts?"
"The domain and email will be registered in YOUR name, under YOUR control. This means you own everything - we're just helping you set it up. You can manage it independently after deployment."

### "Can we start free?"
"Absolutely! We can deploy your website to moialuciie2025.pages.dev immediately (free forever). When you're ready for a custom domain, we upgrade. No pressure."

### "What if we don't like it?"
"No contracts! If you decide not to renew next year, you only lose the domain name. Your website code is backed up on GitHub and remains yours. But honestly, at $21.77/year, it's cheaper than printing business cards."

### "How long does this take?"
"Once you create the Cloudflare account and register the domain (about 30 minutes total), we handle the rest. Website goes live within 48 hours. DNS takes 1-24 hours to propagate globally."

### "Is it secure?"
"Yes! Enterprise-grade Cloudflare infrastructure with automatic SSL (HTTPS). Same security used by major companies worldwide. Your data is protected and your site is DDoS-protected automatically."
